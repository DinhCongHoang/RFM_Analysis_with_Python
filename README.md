<h1>RFM Analysis Project</h1>
<h2>Using Python to perform RFM analysis for SuperStore - A global retail company. This analysis serves as a way to segment customers, determine issues and make recommendation for marketing dept.</h2>
<h2>Context:</h2>
<p>SuperStore Company is a global retail company with lots of customers.</p>
<p>On the occasion of Christmas and New Year, the Marketing Department wants to launch a marketing campaign to thank customers for supporting the company during the past time as well as make potential customers to become loyal.</p>
<p>However, the Marketing Department has not yet been able to group each customer this year because the data set is too large to be processed manually as in previous years, so they asked the Data Analysis Department to assist in classifying each customer into groups to deploy appropriate marketing program for each segment.</p>
<p>The Marketing Director also proposed using the RFM model. When the company was small, the marketing team could calculate and classify customers by themselves using Excel. Now the dataset is too large, so it is expected that the Data Analysis Department will build a program to implement segmentation evaluation by Python programming language."</p>
<h2>Requirement:</h2>
<p>1. Calculate R, F, M score of each customer (1 to 5) base on quintile method.</p>
<p>2. Segmenting customers base on the calculated scores and classification information in the Segmentation table.</p>
<p>3. Analyze company's performance and make suggestions for marketing team.</p>
